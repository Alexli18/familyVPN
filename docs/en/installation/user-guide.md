# User Guide for Family VPN

This guide provides essential information for family members and end users of the VPN server.

## Getting Started

### What You Need

Before you start, make sure you have:
- The VPN server address (IP or domain name) from your administrator
- Access to the web management portal (if available)
- OR a pre-generated `.ovpn` configuration file from your administrator

### Quick Setup Process

1. **Get your VPN configuration** - See [Client Setup Guide](client-setup.md)
2. **Install VPN client software** on your device
3. **Import the configuration** file
4. **Connect and verify** the connection works

For detailed step-by-step instructions, follow the [Client Setup Guide](client-setup.md).

## When to Use VPN

### Always Use VPN When:
- Using public Wi-Fi (coffee shops, airports, hotels)
- Accessing sensitive information
- Banking or shopping online
- Traveling in countries with internet restrictions
- Working with confidential family information

### Optional VPN Use:
- At home on trusted networks (depends on your privacy preferences)
- For general browsing (personal choice)
- Streaming content (may affect speed)

## Understanding VPN Benefits and Limitations

### What VPN DOES:
✅ **Encrypts your internet traffic** - Protects data from eavesdropping  
✅ **Hides your real IP address** - Provides location privacy  
✅ **Protects against network eavesdropping** - Secures public Wi-Fi usage  
✅ **Allows access to geo-restricted content** - Bypass regional blocks  
✅ **Secures family communications** - Protects family network traffic  

### What VPN Does NOT Do:
❌ **Make you completely anonymous online** - Websites can still track you  
❌ **Protect against malware or viruses** - Use antivirus software  
❌ **Secure data stored on your device** - Use device encryption  
❌ **Protect against social engineering attacks** - Stay vigilant  
❌ **Guarantee 100% privacy** - Good practices still needed  

## Security Best Practices

### Protect Your VPN Configuration

1. **Keep `.ovpn` files secure**:
   - Don't share them with others
   - Store them in a safe location
   - Remove from email after downloading

2. **Use strong device security**:
   - Enable screen locks on mobile devices
   - Keep your operating system updated
   - Use antivirus software on computers
   - Enable automatic security updates

3. **Monitor your connections**:
   - Always verify VPN status before browsing
   - Periodically check your IP address
   - Disconnect when not needed to save battery/bandwidth

### What to Do If Device Is Lost or Stolen

**Immediate Actions:**
1. **Contact your administrator immediately**
2. **Report the lost device and request certificate revocation**
3. **Get a new certificate for your replacement device**
4. **Change passwords** for accounts accessed through VPN

**Prevention:**
- Use strong device passwords/PINs
- Enable remote wipe capabilities
- Don't store sensitive information locally
- Regular backups of important data

## Managing Multiple Devices

### Best Practices for Families

1. **Use separate certificates for each device**:
   - Each family member should have their own certificates
   - Use descriptive names: "dad-laptop", "mom-phone", "kids-tablet"

2. **Keep track of your devices**:
   - Maintain a list of which certificate is on which device
   - Note when certificates were created and when they expire

3. **Regular maintenance**:
   - Remove certificates from old/unused devices
   - Request new certificates before expiration
   - Update VPN client software regularly

### Family Device Naming Convention

Use clear, descriptive names for easy management:
- **Format**: `[person]-[device-type]`
- **Examples**: 
  - `john-laptop`
  - `mary-iphone`
  - `kids-ipad`
  - `guest-phone`

## Verifying Your VPN Connection

### Quick Connection Check

After connecting to VPN, verify it's working:

1. **Check your IP address**:
   - Visit: https://whatismyipaddress.com/
   - Should show VPN server location, not your real location

2. **Test for DNS leaks**:
   - Visit: https://dnsleaktest.com/
   - Run the test to ensure DNS goes through VPN

3. **Check for WebRTC leaks**:
   - Visit: https://browserleaks.com/webrtc
   - Ensure your real IP is not visible

### Connection Status Indicators

Most VPN clients show connection status:
- **Green/Connected**: VPN is active and working
- **Yellow/Connecting**: VPN is trying to connect
- **Red/Disconnected**: VPN is not active
- **Orange/Error**: Connection problem needs attention

## Family VPN Etiquette

### Sharing Resources Fairly

- **Don't monopolize bandwidth**: Avoid large downloads during peak family usage
- **Disconnect when not needed**: Save server resources for others
- **Report problems promptly**: Help maintain service for everyone
- **Follow family internet rules**: VPN doesn't change household policies

### Privacy and Respect

- **Respect others' privacy**: Don't try to monitor other family members
- **Use appropriate content**: Follow family guidelines for internet usage
- **Protect shared credentials**: Don't share VPN access with non-family members
- **Be responsible**: Remember that VPN usage may be logged for security

## Advanced Tips for Power Users

### Optimizing Performance

1. **Choose optimal connection times**: Avoid peak usage periods
2. **Use wired connections when possible**: More stable than Wi-Fi
3. **Close unnecessary applications**: Reduce bandwidth competition
4. **Update VPN client regularly**: Get performance improvements

### Security Enhancements

1. **Use VPN with other security tools**: Combine with antivirus, firewall
2. **Enable kill switch if available**: Prevents data leaks if VPN disconnects
3. **Use secure DNS**: Configure DNS over HTTPS when possible
4. **Regular security audits**: Periodically check for IP/DNS leaks
