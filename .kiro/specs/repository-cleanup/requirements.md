# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on cleaning up and organizing the Family VPN Server repository to improve maintainability, reduce clutter, and establish clear organizational patterns. The repository has accumulated numerous backup files, duplicate configurations, and potentially obsolete scripts that need systematic review and cleanup.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this VPN server, I want a clean and organized repository structure, so that I can easily navigate, understand, and maintain the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the repository structure THEN the system SHALL have a clear separation between active files and archived/backup content
2. WHEN examining backup directories THEN the system SHALL retain only necessary backups and remove redundant certificate backup folders
3. WHEN looking at the root directory THEN the system SHALL contain only essential configuration and documentation files
4. IF backup files are older than 30 days AND newer backups exist THEN the system SHALL remove the older backup directories

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with tests, I want all test files properly organized in the test directory, so that I can easily run and maintain the test suite.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining test files THEN all test files SHALL be located in the `/test` directory
2. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL have clear npm scripts for running different test suites
3. WHEN reviewing test files THEN duplicate or obsolete test files SHALL be removed or consolidated
4. IF test files exist outside the test directory THEN they SHALL be moved to the appropriate location with updated import paths

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer managing scripts, I want only relevant and functional scripts in the scripts directory, so that I can trust all available automation tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the scripts directory THEN all scripts SHALL have clear purposes and be documented
2. WHEN examining script functionality THEN obsolete or duplicate scripts SHALL be removed
3. WHEN running scripts THEN they SHALL execute without errors and perform their intended functions
4. IF scripts are no longer needed THEN they SHALL be removed from the repository

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer working with configuration files, I want a clear distinction between example, development, and production configurations, so that I can avoid configuration conflicts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining configuration files THEN there SHALL be clear naming conventions for different environments
2. WHEN reviewing environment files THEN duplicate or conflicting configurations SHALL be resolved
3. WHEN working with Docker configurations THEN only necessary compose files SHALL be present
4. IF configuration files are redundant THEN they SHALL be consolidated or removed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining documentation, I want up-to-date and relevant documentation files, so that I can understand and contribute to the project effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN all documentation SHALL be current and accurate
2. WHEN examining README files THEN they SHALL reflect the current state of the project
3. WHEN looking at security documentation THEN it SHALL be comprehensive and up-to-date
4. IF documentation is outdated or redundant THEN it SHALL be updated or removed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer managing dependencies, I want a clean package.json with only necessary dependencies, so that the project remains lightweight and secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining package.json THEN all dependencies SHALL be actively used in the codebase
2. WHEN reviewing npm scripts THEN they SHALL all be functional and relevant
3. WHEN checking for unused dependencies THEN they SHALL be removed
4. IF development dependencies are mixed with production dependencies THEN they SHALL be properly categorized
