# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical security vulnerabilities and DevOps improvements for a private OpenVPN server implementation. The current system has several high-risk security issues including hardcoded credentials, insufficient access controls, missing security configurations, and inadequate monitoring capabilities. This enhancement will transform the system into a production-ready, secure VPN solution following industry best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want all hardcoded credentials removed from the codebase, so that unauthorized access is prevented and credentials can be managed securely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN no hardcoded passwords SHALL be present in any source code files
2. WHEN authentication is required THEN the system SHALL use environment variables or secure credential management
3. WHEN credentials are stored THEN they SHALL be encrypted or hashed using industry-standard algorithms
4. WHEN accessing the certificate generation endpoint THEN multi-factor authentication SHALL be required

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities, so that I can track system health, security events, and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any system event occurs THEN structured logs SHALL be generated with appropriate log levels
2. WHEN security events occur THEN they SHALL be logged with detailed context and timestamps
3. WHEN the system is running THEN health metrics SHALL be exposed for monitoring systems
4. WHEN log rotation is needed THEN logs SHALL be automatically rotated to prevent disk space issues
5. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN alerts SHALL be generated

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a security engineer, I want the OpenVPN server configuration hardened according to security best practices, so that the VPN connection is secure against known attack vectors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenVPN is configured THEN strong encryption algorithms SHALL be used (AES-256-GCM)
2. WHEN client connections are established THEN perfect forward secrecy SHALL be enforced
3. WHEN certificates are generated THEN they SHALL use strong key sizes (minimum 2048-bit RSA or 256-bit ECC)
4. WHEN the server starts THEN unnecessary services and ports SHALL be disabled
5. WHEN traffic flows through the VPN THEN DNS leak protection SHALL be enforced

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated certificate management with proper lifecycle handling, so that certificates are renewed before expiration and revoked when compromised.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN certificates approach expiration THEN automated renewal SHALL be triggered
2. WHEN certificates need to be revoked THEN a proper revocation process SHALL be available
3. WHEN client certificates are generated THEN they SHALL have appropriate validity periods
4. WHEN certificate operations occur THEN they SHALL be logged and auditable
5. WHEN the CA private key is accessed THEN additional security measures SHALL be enforced

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a secure and automated deployment pipeline, so that the VPN server can be deployed consistently across environments with proper security controls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL use multi-stage Docker builds for security
2. WHEN containers are running THEN they SHALL run with minimal privileges and non-root users
3. WHEN secrets are needed THEN they SHALL be injected securely at runtime
4. WHEN the deployment occurs THEN security scanning SHALL be performed on container images
5. WHEN configuration changes are made THEN they SHALL be version controlled and auditable

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want proper network security controls and traffic filtering, so that only authorized traffic flows through the VPN and network segmentation is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clients connect THEN their traffic SHALL be filtered based on defined policies
2. WHEN the VPN server starts THEN firewall rules SHALL be automatically configured
3. WHEN traffic routing occurs THEN split-tunneling options SHALL be available
4. WHEN network access is granted THEN it SHALL be based on client certificate attributes
5. WHEN suspicious network activity is detected THEN it SHALL be blocked and logged

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want comprehensive documentation and audit capabilities, so that the system meets regulatory requirements and security standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN complete documentation SHALL be available
2. WHEN security configurations are applied THEN they SHALL be documented with rationale
3. WHEN audit events occur THEN they SHALL be recorded in tamper-evident logs
4. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN they SHALL be automatically generated
5. WHEN security assessments are performed THEN the system SHALL provide necessary evidence

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want automated backup and disaster recovery capabilities, so that the VPN service can be quickly restored in case of system failure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN critical data SHALL be automatically backed up
2. WHEN backups are created THEN they SHALL be encrypted and stored securely
3. WHEN disaster recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL be restorable within defined RTO/RPO
4. WHEN backup integrity is questioned THEN verification processes SHALL be available
5. WHEN recovery procedures are executed THEN they SHALL be documented and tested
