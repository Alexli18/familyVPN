# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The family VPN server has been over-engineered with enterprise-level complexity that is inappropriate for its intended use case. While security hardening was successfully implemented, the system now includes unnecessary enterprise features like complex alerting systems, correlation ID tracking, advanced system monitoring, and automated certificate renewal that add maintenance burden without providing value for a family VPN deployment. This specification aims to simplify the codebase while maintaining essential security features, making the system more maintainable and appropriate for its family use case.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a family VPN administrator, I want the alerting system completely removed, so that I don't have to maintain SMTP configurations and complex notification systems that are unnecessary for family use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN no email alerting dependencies SHALL be present
2. WHEN security events occur THEN they SHALL be logged but not trigger email alerts
3. WHEN the codebase is reviewed THEN no alerting service code SHALL remain
4. WHEN dependencies are checked THEN nodemailer and related packages SHALL be removed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the family VPN, I want simplified logging without correlation IDs and complex tracking, so that the logging system is easier to understand and maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN log entries are created THEN they SHALL use simple structured format without correlation IDs
2. WHEN logging methods are called THEN they SHALL not require correlation ID parameters
3. WHEN security events are logged THEN they SHALL use standard log levels without tamper-evident features
4. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL use a single winston logger instance instead of multiple specialized loggers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a family VPN operator, I want simplified health monitoring that provides basic status without complex system analysis, so that I can check if the service is running without enterprise-level monitoring overhead.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the health endpoint is accessed THEN it SHALL return simple status information
2. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL not perform complex CPU, memory, or disk monitoring
3. WHEN health checks occur THEN they SHALL not include OpenVPN process monitoring
4. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN basic HTTP request counting SHALL be sufficient

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a family VPN administrator, I want simplified certificate management without automated renewal and complex validation, so that certificate operations are straightforward and don't require enterprise PKI management knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN certificates are generated THEN they SHALL use basic generation without automated renewal
2. WHEN certificate operations occur THEN they SHALL not include complex integrity checking
3. WHEN certificates are managed THEN basic file permissions and CRL generation SHALL be sufficient
4. WHEN certificate validation is needed THEN simple validation SHALL be used without enterprise-level audit trails

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer working on the family VPN, I want the main server integration simplified by removing complex service orchestration, so that the application startup and operation is easier to understand and debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL not initialize complex alerting or monitoring services
2. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be handled with simplified logging calls
3. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL maintain essential security middleware without enterprise complexity
4. WHEN certificate generation is requested THEN it SHALL work without triggering complex alerting workflows

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a family VPN maintainer, I want unnecessary dependencies removed from the project, so that the attack surface is reduced and the project is easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the package.json is reviewed THEN alerting-related dependencies SHALL be removed
2. WHEN the project is built THEN it SHALL not include unused enterprise monitoring libraries
3. WHEN security scanning occurs THEN fewer dependencies SHALL reduce potential vulnerabilities
4. WHEN the Docker image is built THEN it SHALL be smaller due to removed dependencies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a family VPN user, I want all existing functionality to continue working after simplification, so that authentication, certificate generation, and VPN connectivity remain reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication is attempted THEN it SHALL work with JWT and bcrypt as before
2. WHEN certificates are generated THEN they SHALL be created with proper security settings
3. WHEN the VPN server runs THEN clients SHALL be able to connect successfully
4. WHEN the Docker deployment occurs THEN all security hardening SHALL remain intact
5. WHEN tests are run THEN all essential functionality SHALL pass validation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a family VPN administrator, I want the simplified system to maintain appropriate security features, so that the VPN remains secure while being easier to operate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system operates THEN secure authentication with rate limiting SHALL be maintained
2. WHEN logging occurs THEN security events SHALL still be recorded appropriately
3. WHEN certificates are managed THEN proper file permissions and basic security SHALL be enforced
4. WHEN the VPN runs THEN OpenVPN security configuration SHALL remain hardened
5. WHEN Docker deployment occurs THEN container security measures SHALL be preserved
