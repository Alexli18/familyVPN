# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds a web-based user interface to the Family VPN Server, providing secure authentication and certificate management capabilities. The interface will allow authorized users to log in and generate new client certificates through a clean, responsive web interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a VPN administrator, I want a secure login page so that only authorized users can access the certificate management interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the web interface THEN the system SHALL display a login form with username and password fields
2. WHEN a user submits valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate the user and redirect to the certificate management page
3. WHEN a user submits invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL display an error message and remain on the login page
4. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL redirect all protected routes to the login page
5. WHEN a user successfully logs in THEN the system SHALL create a secure session that expires after a configurable timeout

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, I want a certificate generation page so that I can create new client certificates for VPN access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the certificate page THEN the system SHALL display a form to generate new certificates
2. WHEN a user enters a client name THEN the system SHALL validate the name format and uniqueness
3. WHEN a user submits a valid certificate request THEN the system SHALL generate a new client certificate and private key
4. WHEN certificate generation is successful THEN the system SHALL provide a download link for the .ovpn configuration file
5. WHEN certificate generation fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message explaining the failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a responsive and intuitive interface so that I can easily manage certificates from any device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the interface is accessed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL display a mobile-optimized layout
2. WHEN the interface is accessed on desktop THEN the system SHALL display a desktop-optimized layout
3. WHEN forms are submitted THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback during processing
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
5. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL provide clear success confirmation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security-conscious administrator, I want the web interface to follow security best practices so that the VPN server remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling user sessions THEN the system SHALL use secure, HTTP-only cookies
2. WHEN transmitting data THEN the system SHALL enforce HTTPS in production environments
3. WHEN storing passwords THEN the system SHALL use proper password hashing
4. WHEN handling file downloads THEN the system SHALL validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
5. WHEN logging user actions THEN the system SHALL record authentication attempts and certificate generation events

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see existing certificates so that I can manage and track issued certificates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses the certificate page THEN the system SHALL display a list of existing certificates
2. WHEN displaying certificates THEN the system SHALL show certificate name, creation date, and status
3. WHEN a certificate is selected THEN the system SHALL provide options to download or revoke the certificate
4. WHEN certificates are revoked THEN the system SHALL update the certificate revocation list
5. WHEN the certificate list is empty THEN the system SHALL display a helpful message encouraging certificate creation
